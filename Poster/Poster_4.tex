	\textbf{Given:}
	
	$ D $ is a set of documents, $ W $ is a set of terms, $n_{dw}$ is a frequency of term $w$ in document $d$.
	
	\medskip\textbf{Find} model: 
	\[ 
	p(w|d) = \sum_{t\in T} p(w|t) p(t|d) = \sum_{t\in T} \varphi_{wt} \theta_{td}
	\] 
	with parameters $\varphi_{wt}$, $\theta_{td}$:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $ \varphi_{wt} = p(w|t)$ is a distribution over terms in topic $ t $;
	\item $ \theta_{td} = p(t|d) $ is a distribution over topics in document $ d $. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Optimization task} is
	regularized likelihood maximization:
  \[\small
        \underbrace{\sum_{d\in D} \sum_{w\in d} \!n_{dw} \ln \sum_{t\in T} \phi_{wt}\theta_{td}}_{L(\Phi,\Theta)}

        {\underbrace{{\sum_{i=1}^n \tau_i R_i(\Phi,\Theta)}}_{R(\Phi,\Theta)}}

\headerbox{Convergence theorem}{name=convergence,column=1,below=statement}{
Denote $x^k$ as value of $x$ at $k$-th iteration.
 Suppose that
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $ n^k_{wt} = 0 \Rightarrow \phi^k_{wt} = 0$ , $n^k_{td} = 0 \Rightarrow \theta^k_{td} = 0$ -- saving zero.
\item $\exists \varepsilon>0\ \exists N\ \forall k > N\ \phi^k_{wt}, \theta^k_{td} \notin (0, \varepsilon)$ -- separability from zero.
\item  $ n_{dw}>0 \Rightarrow \forall k\ \exists t\colon p^k_{tdw} > 0$ -- likelihood is finite during iterations.
\item $\exists \delta >0\ \exists N\ \forall k > N \ \forall t\ \exists w\  n^k_{wt} + r^k_{wt} > \delta$ and the similar condition for $\theta$ -- separability from zero of the denominator. It's a criteria for topic selection.
\item $\exists N\ \forall k > N\colon\ \ Q^k (\phi^k, \theta^k)+ R(\phi^k, \theta^k) \geq Q^k(\phi^{k-1}, \theta^{k-1}) + R(\phi^{k-1}, \theta^{k-1})$, where $Q^k(\phi, \theta) = \sum\limits_{t,d,w} p^k_{tdw} (\ln \phi_{wt} + \ln \theta_{td})$ -- Increase of the lower bound of regularized likelihood during iterations. 
\end{enumerate}
Then for  $k \to \infty$
\[
\|\phi^k - \phi^{k-1}\|_1 \to 0 \text{ and }\|\theta^k - \theta^{k-1}\|_1 \to 0 .

\headerbox{Regularized EM}{name=regem, column=2, below=statement}{
    Applying Karush--Kuhn--Tucker theorem, 
    one can obtain the following EM-algorithm:
    
   \textbf{E-step:}
    
    $p_{tdw} \propto \varphi_{wt} \theta_{td}$
 \smallskip
   
    \textbf{M-step:}
    
    $n_{wt} = \sum\limits_{d \in D} n_{dw} p_{tdw}$
    
    $n_{td} = \sum\limits_{w \in W} n_{dw} p_{tdw}$
    
   $r_{wt} =  \phi_{wt}\tfrac{\partial R}{\partial\phi_{wt}}$,~~ $r_{td} =  \theta_{td}\tfrac{\partial R}{\partial\theta_{td}}$

    $\phi_{wt}   \propto \bigl(n_{wt} + r_{wt} \bigr)_{\!+}$,~~ $\theta_{td} \propto  \bigl(n_{td} + r_{td}\bigr)_{\!+}$
}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Unbiased Modification}{name=unbiasedem,column=2,below=regem}{
    Replacing $\phi_{wt}$ and $\theta_{td}$ with their unbiased maximum likelihood estimators on M-step doesn't deteriorate the convergence but simplifies calculations:
 \smallskip
    
  $ r_{wt} =  \dfrac{n_{wt}}{n_t}\dfrac{\partial R}{\partial\phi_{wt}} \bigg( \dfrac{n_{wt}}{n_t},  \dfrac{n_{td}}{n_d} \bigg)$
 \smallskip
 
   $r_{td} =\dfrac{n_{td}}{n_d}\dfrac{\partial R}{\partial\theta_{td}}  \bigg( \dfrac{n_{wt}}{n_t},  \dfrac{n_{td}}{n_d} \bigg)$
 \smallskip
 
    Under conditions of the convergence theorem and with this modification  one can estimate the change of $R$ on M-step:
\[
\Delta R=  \frac12 \sum\limits_{t, w, u}   \frac{1}{\sum\limits_v n_{vt}} \bigg(  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{wt}}}  -  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{ut}}}  \bigg)^2 \phi_{wt} \phi_{ut}  + 
\]
\[
+ \frac12 \sum\limits_{d, t, s}   \frac{1}{\sum\limits_r n_{rd}} \bigg(  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{td}}}  -  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{sd}}}  \bigg)^2 \theta_{td} \theta_{sd}  \geq 0
\]
}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\headerbox{Gradient Modification}{name=gradientem,column=2,below=unbiasedem}{
One suggests to use the gradient of regulariser as regularization additives. It may improve the convergence and doesn't complicate the calculations.
\smallskip
\smallskip

$r_{wt} =  \frac{1}{\sum\limits_w n_{wt}} \big( \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{wt}}} - \sum\limits_u \phi_{ut} \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{ut}}} \big)$

$ r_{td} =  \frac{1}{\sum\limits_t n_{td}} \big( \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{td}}} - \sum\limits_s \theta_{sd} \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{sd}}} \big)$
\smallskip

The negative additive is common for all topics(documents) so it can be efficiently computed not impacting on the asymptotic of the algorithm.

\headerbox{Conclusion}{name=conclusion,column=2,below=gradientem}{

\textbf{Dataset}: sport topics, $|D|=18000$, $|W|=20000$, $|T|=7$. Three versions of M-step (original, unbiased modification and gradient modification) were compared.  EM algorithm was launched from 200 random initial states and functionals were averaged over iterations. Results are presented below for regularizer of decorrelation ($R = \tau\sum_{t, w\neq u} \phi_{wt}\phi_{ut}$)  with different values of $\tau$ ($-10^5, -10^6$).
