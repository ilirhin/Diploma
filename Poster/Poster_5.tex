	\textbf{Given:}
	
	$ D $ is a set of documents, $ W $ is a set of terms, $n_{dw}$ is a frequency of term $w$ in document $d$.

	p(w|d) = \sum_{t\in T} p(w|t) p(t|d) = \sum_{t\in T} \varphi_{wt} \theta_{td}

\headerbox{Convergence theorem}{name=convergence,column=1,below=statement}{
Let $k$ be the the index of the iteration. Suppose the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Preserving zeros.
\smallskip

$ n^k_{wt} = 0 \Rightarrow \phi^k_{wt} = 0$ , $n^k_{td} = 0 \Rightarrow \theta^k_{td} = 0$.
\item Separation from zero of $\phi$ and $\theta$.
\smallskip

$\exists \varepsilon>0\ \exists N\ \forall k > N\ \phi^k_{wt}, \theta^k_{td} \notin (0, \varepsilon)$. 
\item  Likelihood is finite during iterations.
\smallskip

$ n_{dw}>0 \Rightarrow \forall k\ \exists t\colon p^k_{tdw} > 0$.
\item Separation of the denominator.
\smallskip

$\exists \delta >0\ \exists N\ \forall k > N \ \forall t\ \exists w\  n^k_{wt} + r^k_{wt} > \delta$ and the similar condition for $\theta$. 
\item Growth of the lower bound of regularized likelihood during iterations.
\smallskip

$\exists N\ \forall k > N\colon\ \ Q^k (\phi^k, \theta^k)+ R(\phi^k, \theta^k) \geq Q^k(\phi^{k-1}, \theta^{k-1}) + R(\phi^{k-1}, \theta^{k-1})$, where $Q^k(\phi, \theta) = \sum\limits_{t,d,w} p^k_{tdw} (\ln \phi_{wt} + \ln \theta_{td})$.
\end{enumerate}
Then for  $k \to \infty$

\headerbox{Regularized EM}{name=regem, column=2, below=statement}{
    Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theorem justifies the following EM-algorithm:
    
   \textbf{E-step:}
    
    $p_{tdw} \propto \varphi_{wt} \theta_{td}$
 \smallskip
   
    \textbf{M-step:}
    
    $n_{wt} = \sum\limits_{d \in D} n_{dw} p_{tdw}$
    
    $n_{td} = \sum\limits_{w \in W} n_{dw} p_{tdw}$
    
   $r_{wt} =  \phi_{wt}\tfrac{\partial R}{\partial\phi_{wt}}$,~~ $r_{td} =  \theta_{td}\tfrac{\partial R}{\partial\theta_{td}}$

    $\phi_{wt}   \propto \bigl(n_{wt} + r_{wt} \bigr)_{\!+}$,~~ $\theta_{td} \propto  \bigl(n_{td} + r_{td}\bigr)_{\!+}$
}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Unbiased Modification}{name=unbiasedem,column=2,below=regem}{
    Replacing $\phi_{wt}$ and $\theta_{td}$ with their unbiased maximum likelihood estimators on M-step preserves the convergence and simplifies calculations:
 \smallskip
    
  $ r_{wt} =  \dfrac{n_{wt}}{n_t}\dfrac{\partial R}{\partial\phi_{wt}} \bigg( \dfrac{n_{wt}}{n_t},  \dfrac{n_{td}}{n_d} \bigg)$
 \smallskip
 
   $r_{td} =\dfrac{n_{td}}{n_d}\dfrac{\partial R}{\partial\theta_{td}}  \bigg( \dfrac{n_{wt}}{n_t},  \dfrac{n_{td}}{n_d} \bigg)$
 \smallskip
 
    Under conditions of the convergence theorem and with this modification  one can estimate the change of $R$ on M-step:
\[
\Delta R=  \frac12 \sum\limits_{t, w, u}   \frac{1}{\sum\limits_v n_{vt}} \bigg(  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{wt}}}  -  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{ut}}}  \bigg)^2 \phi_{wt} \phi_{ut}  + 
\]
\[
+ \frac12 \sum\limits_{d, t, s}   \frac{1}{\sum\limits_r n_{rd}} \bigg(  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{td}}}  -  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{sd}}}  \bigg)^2 \theta_{td} \theta_{sd}  \geq 0
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\headerbox{Gradient Modification}{name=gradientem,column=2,below=unbiasedem}{
Using the gradient of regularizer as $r_{wt}$ and $r_{td}$ may improve the convergence and does not complicate the calculations.
\smallskip
\smallskip

$r_{wt} =  \frac{1}{\sum\limits_w n_{wt}} \big( \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{wt}}} - \sum\limits_u \phi_{ut} \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{ut}}} \big)$

$ r_{td} =  \frac{1}{\sum\limits_t n_{td}} \big( \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{td}}} - \sum\limits_s \theta_{sd} \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{sd}}} \big)$
\smallskip

The negative additive is common for all topics (documents) so it can be efficiently computed without impacting the asymptotic of the algorithm.

We use dataset obtained from sport news website, $|D|=18000$, $|W|=20000$, $|T|=7$. We compare three variations of M-step (original, unbiased modification and gradient modification).  EM algorithm was launched from 200 random initial states and functionals were averaged over iterations. Results are presented below for decorrelation regularizer ($R = \tau\sum_{t, w\neq u} \phi_{wt}\phi_{ut}$)  with different values of $\tau$ ($-10^5, -10^6$).
