\headerbox{Regularized EM}{name=baseem, column=1, row=0}{
    Applying Karush--Kuhn--Tucker theorem, 
    one can obtain the following EM-algorithm:
    
   \textbf{E-step:}
    
    $p_{tdw} \propto \varphi_{wt} \theta_{td}$
 \smallskip
   
    \textbf{M-step:}
    
    $n_{wt} = \sum\limits_{d \in D} n_{dw} p_{tdw}$
    
    $n_{td} = \sum\limits_{w \in W} n_{dw} p_{tdw}$
    
   $r_{wt} =  \phi_{wt}\tfrac{\partial R}{\partial\phi_{wt}}$, $r_{td} =  \theta_{td}\tfrac{\partial R}{\partial\theta_{td}}$

    $\phi_{wt}   \propto \bigl(n_{wt} + r_{wt} \bigr)_{\!+}$, $\theta_{td} \propto  \bigl(n_{td} + r_{td}\bigr)_{\!+}$
}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \headerbox{Unbiased Modification}{name=em,column=2,row=0}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Replacing $\phi_{wt}$ and $\theta_{td}$ with their unbiased maximum likelihood estimators on M-step doesn't deteriorate the convergence but simplifies calculations:
    
  $ r_{wt} =  \frac{n_{wt}}{n_t}\dfrac{\partial R}{\partial\phi_{wt}} \big( \frac{n_{wt}}{n_t},  \frac{n_{td}}{n_d} \big)$

   $r_{td} =\frac{n_{td}}{n_d}\dfrac{\partial R}{\partial\theta_{td}}  \big( \frac{n_{wt}}{n_t},  \frac{n_{td}}{n_d} \big)$
    
    \vspace{0.8em}
    Under conditions of the convergence theorem and with this modification  one can estimate the change of $R$ on M-step:
\[
\Delta R=  \frac12 \sum\limits_{t, w, u}   \frac{1}{\sum\limits_v n_{vt}} \bigg(  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{wt}}}  -  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{ut}}}  \bigg)^2 \phi_{wt} \phi_{ut}  + 
\]
\[
+ \frac12 \sum\limits_{d, t, s}   \frac{1}{\sum\limits_r n_{rd}} \bigg(  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{td}}}  -  \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{sd}}}  \bigg)^2 \theta_{td} \theta_{sd}  \geq 0
\]

  \headerbox{Convergence theorem}{name=convergence,column=1,below=baseem}{
Denote $x^k$ as value of $x$ on $k$-th iteration.
 Suppose that
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $ n^k_{wt} = 0 \Rightarrow \phi^k_{wt} = 0$ , $n^k_{td} = 0 \Rightarrow \theta^k_{td} = 0$ -- saving zero.
\item $\exists \varepsilon>0\ \exists N\ \forall k > N\ \phi^k_{wt}, \theta^k_{td} \notin (0, \varepsilon)$ -- separability from zero.
\item  $ n_{dw}>0 \Rightarrow \forall k\ \exists t\colon p^k_{tdw} > 0$ -- likelihood is finite during iterations.
\item $\exists \delta >0\ \exists N\ \forall k > N \ \forall t\ \exists w\  n^k_{wt} + r^k_{wt} > \delta$ and the similar condition for $\theta$ -- separability from zero of the denominator. It's a criteria for topic selection.
\item $\exists N\ \forall k > N\colon\ \ Q^k (\phi^k, \theta^k)+ R(\phi^k, \theta^k) \geq Q^k(\phi^{k-1}, \theta^{k-1}) + R(\phi^{k-1}, \theta^{k-1})$, where $Q^k(\phi, \theta) = \sum\limits_{t,d,w} p^k_{tdw} (\ln \phi_{wt} + \ln \theta_{td})$ -- Increase of the lower bound of regularized likelihood during iterations. 
\end{enumerate}
Then for  $k \to \infty$
\[
\|\phi^k - \phi^{k-1}\|_1 \to 0, \|\theta^k - \theta^{k-1}\|_1 \to 0 .

  \headerbox{Gradient Modification}{name=eme,column=2,below=em}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
One suggests to use the gradient of regulariser as regularization additives. It may improve the convergence and doesn't complicate the calculations.
\smallskip
\smallskip

$r_{wt} =  \frac{1}{\sum\limits_w n_{wt}} \big( \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{wt}}} - \sum\limits_u \phi_{ut} \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\phi_{ut}}} \big)$

$ r_{td} =  \frac{1}{\sum\limits_t n_{td}} \big( \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{td}}} - \sum\limits_s \theta_{sd} \frac{\partial{R}}{\partial{\theta_{sd}}} \big)$
\smallskip

The negative additive is common for all topics(documents) so it can be efficiently computed not impacting on the asymptotic of the algorithm.
